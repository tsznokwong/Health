/// The `Health` class provides a concrete implementation of the `HealthProtocol` protocol that
/// applications can instantiate and then register one or more health checks against. Once you
/// have your health checks in place you can ask your `Health` instance for its status.
///
///### Usage Example: ###
/// One common use case for this Swift package is to integrate it into a Kitura-based application. In the code sample below, the health of the application is exposed through the /health endpoint. Cloud environments (e.g. Cloud Foundry, Kubernetes, etc.) can then use the status information returned from the /health endpoint to monitor and manage the Swift application instance.
///
/// For further information and example code see our [README](https://github.com/IBM-Swift/Health/blob/master/README.md) and the [Cloud Foundry documentation for using application health checks](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/healthchecks.html).
///```swift
/// import Health
///
/// let health = Health()
///
/// health.addCheck(check: MyCheck1())
/// health.addCheck(check: myClosureCheck1)
///
/// // Define /health endpoint that leverages Health
/// router.get("/health") { request, response, next in
///    let status = health.status
///    if health.status.state == .UP {
///        try response.status(.OK).send(status).end()
///    } else {
///        try response.status(.serviceUnavailable).send(status).end()
///    }
/// }
